And now you must be realizing </tspan><tspan x="0" y="159">why I used the term &quot;Troglodyte&quot; for me!</tspan><tspan x="0" y="177"> </tspan><tspan x="0" y="195">If this place has fascinated a homebody like me then trust me an outdoorsy </tspan><tspan x="0" y="213">will fall for this place. </tspan><tspan x="0" y="231"></tspan><tspan x="0" y="249">The best part of visiting this place is the beauty of not only the location but </tspan><tspan x="0" y="267">also of the entire journey, from Mahad it takes about 20 minutes to reach the </tspan><tspan x="0" y="285">village, and here&apos;s where you need to keep your vehicle and walk ahead to </tspan><tspan x="0" y="303">your destination for approximately 30 minutes ...</tspan><tspan x="0" y="321">Nah!

Walking on those tiny pathways made from mud and cow dung </tspan><tspan x="0" y="465">gives you a very typical village vibe. Immediate after the village there is a river </tspan><tspan x="0" y="483">with a small bridge connecting the fields and village. And now you will be </tspan><tspan x="0" y="501">walking on the small pathway between the fields of rice and witnessing the </tspan><tspan x="0" y="519">eye and mind pleasing greenery. Make sure you are wearing shoes with great </tspan><tspan x="0" y="537">grip because chances of skidding are very high as you will be also crossing </tspan><tspan x="0" y="555">the river stream, clambering on the rocks near the waterfall.
